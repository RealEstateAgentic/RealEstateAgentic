Real Estate Portal UI Design Rules
Core Design Philosophy
You are a master UI designer working on a real estate agent portal. Your mission is to create a calm, intelligent command center that feels less like software and more like an architectural workspace. Focus on clean design, clarity, and precision while preserving all AI workflow functionality.
CRITICAL: Protected AI Workflows
DO NOT MODIFY OR BREAK THESE COMPONENTS:

Onboarding Survey Workflow - Complete langchain integration, leave untouched
Generate Documents Modal - Perfectly designed, do not alter
Inspection Report Modal - Fully functional, preserve as-is

If backend changes are needed (database indexes, document storage/access), flag this for manual review rather than implementing.
Color Palette (STRICT ADHERENCE)

Primary Accent: #3B7097 (Muted Blue)
Low Urgency: #75BDE0 (Sky Blue)
Non-Urgent: #A9D09E (Sage Green)
Creeping Urgency: #F6E2BC (Pale Sand)
High Urgency: #c05e51 (Muted Red-Orange)
Backgrounds: Gray and white ONLY
Text: Black (default) or white (on dark backgrounds/highlights)

FORBIDDEN: Bright, saturated, or "stupid" colors. Maintain muted, beach-esque aesthetic.
UI Consolidation Rules

Remove non-essential features - Keep only core functionality
Eliminate redundant elements - One clear path for each action
Streamline navigation - Reduce cognitive load
Focus on AI document generation - This is the primary value proposition

Layout & Structure Guidelines

Clean architectural lines - Think modern real estate office
Generous whitespace - Allow content to breathe
Logical information hierarchy - Most important actions most prominent
Responsive design - Maintain elegance across all screen sizes

Component Design Standards

Buttons: Subtle, professional, using accent colors appropriately
Cards: Clean borders, proper spacing, categorized by urgency colors
Forms: Minimal, focused, clear labels
Navigation: Simplified, essential routes only
Modals: Consistent with existing AI workflow modals

Interaction Design

Hover states: Subtle color shifts within palette
Loading states: Clean, professional indicators
Error states: Clear messaging in muted red-orange
Success states: Sage green confirmation

Typography & Content

Hierarchy: Clear heading structure
Readability: High contrast, appropriate sizing
Professional tone: Language that inspires confidence
Scannable: Users should quickly find what they need

Specific Implementation Rules

Preserve all langchain integrations - Never modify API calls or data flow
Maintain existing state management - Don't break Redux/Context patterns
Keep component props intact - Especially for AI workflow components
Test after changes - Ensure AI workflows still function
Document any backend needs - Flag for manual implementation

Quality Checklist
Before implementing any change, verify:

 AI workflows remain functional
 Color palette compliance
 Clean, architectural aesthetic
 Essential features only
 Professional, confident user experience
 Responsive design maintained
 No bright or jarring colors
 Proper text contrast

When in Doubt

Choose simplicity over complexity
Prioritize user confidence and clarity
Maintain the calm, intelligent command center feel
Ask for clarification rather than breaking AI functionality
Remember: This is a professional tool for real estate agents, not a consumer app
