# Active Context: Real Estate Agentic

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization
- **Status**: Just completed
- **Action**: Created core memory bank structure with all 6 required files
- **Next**: Ready to proceed with feature development

### Immediate Priority: Repair Estimator Development
The repair estimator screen currently exists as a placeholder and needs to be fully implemented as the primary feature.

## Recent Changes

### Git Configuration
- Updated global git config with new user identity
- Name: Andrew Shindyapin
- Email: andrei.shindyapin@gmail.com

### Project Structure
- Confirmed basic Electron application structure is in place
- Main screen with branding completed
- Repair estimator screen exists as placeholder
- Navigation system implemented with simple state-based routing

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Repair Estimator Core (High Priority)
1. **Design the interface** - Create form components for property input
2. **Implement data structure** - Define repair category types and cost models
3. **Build calculation engine** - Create logic for cost estimation
4. **Add state management** - Implement proper data flow
5. **Create results display** - Show estimated costs with breakdown

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Photo upload capability** - Allow property photos for analysis
2. **Custom repair items** - Let users add specific repair needs
3. **Cost adjustment tools** - Allow manual override of estimates
4. **Export functionality** - Generate reports in PDF/CSV format

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. **AI integration** - Add intelligent cost analysis
2. **Database storage** - Persist property analysis data
3. **Property comparison** - Compare multiple properties
4. **Market analysis** - Add market data integration

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using simple state-based routing instead of React Router for simplicity
- Maintaining current component structure with shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for styling consistency

### Pending Decisions
- How to structure repair cost data (categories, items, pricing)
- Whether to implement local storage or full database
- AI service integration approach (local vs. cloud)
- Report export format preferences

## Current Challenges

### Development Challenges
- Need to define comprehensive repair cost categories
- Determine appropriate cost calculation algorithms
- Design intuitive user interface for complex data input

### Technical Considerations
- Balancing feature completeness with development timeline
- Ensuring accurate cost estimation without extensive market data
- Maintaining desktop application performance

## Key Resources
- Existing UI components in `src/renderer/components/ui/`
- Layout component handles navigation
- Current screens in `src/renderer/screens/`
- Shared types and utilities in `src/shared/`

## Development Environment
- Node.js v16+ with npm
- Development server running with hot reload
- Electron with React and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Biome for linting and formatting
