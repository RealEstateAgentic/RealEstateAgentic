# Active Context: Real Estate Agentic

## Current Work Focus

### Firebase Backend Integration
- **Status**: Just completed
- **Action**: Added complete Firebase backend with authentication, Firestore, and storage
- **Next**: Ready to integrate Firebase with UI components

### Immediate Priority: Repair Estimator Development
The repair estimator screen currently exists as a placeholder and needs to be fully implemented as the primary feature with Firebase integration.

## Recent Changes

### Firebase Backend Integration
- **Firebase SDK**: Installed and configured Firebase v10+
- **Authentication**: Complete auth service with registration, login, logout
- **Firestore**: Database service for properties and repair estimates
- **Storage**: File upload service for property and repair photos
- **React Hooks**: Custom hooks for Firebase integration
- **Types**: Comprehensive type definitions for all Firebase data

### Git Configuration
- Updated global git config with new user identity
- Name: Andrew Shindyapin
- Email: andrei.shindyapin@gmail.com

### Project Structure
- Confirmed basic Electron application structure is in place
- Main screen with branding completed
- Repair estimator screen exists as placeholder
- Navigation system implemented with simple state-based routing
- Memory bank documentation system initialized

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Repair Estimator Core (High Priority)
1. **Add authentication UI** - Create login/registration components
2. **Design property input interface** - Create form components for property details
3. **Implement repair estimator form** - Use Firebase types and repair categories
4. **Build calculation engine** - Create logic for cost estimation with Firebase storage
5. **Create results display** - Show estimated costs with breakdown and Firebase persistence

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Photo upload capability** - Integrate Firebase storage for property photos
2. **Custom repair items** - Let users add specific repair needs with Firebase persistence
3. **Cost adjustment tools** - Allow manual override of estimates
4. **Export functionality** - Generate reports in PDF/CSV format
5. **User dashboard** - Show saved properties and estimates

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. **AI integration** - Add intelligent cost analysis
2. **Property comparison** - Compare multiple properties
3. **Market analysis** - Add market data integration
4. **Team collaboration** - Share estimates with team members

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using simple state-based routing instead of React Router for simplicity
- Maintaining current component structure with shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for styling consistency

### Pending Decisions
- How to structure repair cost data (categories, items, pricing)
- Whether to implement local storage or full database
- AI service integration approach (local vs. cloud)
- Report export format preferences

## Current Challenges

### Development Challenges
- Need to define comprehensive repair cost categories
- Determine appropriate cost calculation algorithms
- Design intuitive user interface for complex data input

### Technical Considerations
- Balancing feature completeness with development timeline
- Ensuring accurate cost estimation without extensive market data
- Maintaining desktop application performance

## Key Resources
- Existing UI components in `src/renderer/components/ui/`
- Layout component handles navigation
- Current screens in `src/renderer/screens/`
- Shared types and utilities in `src/shared/`

## Development Environment
- Node.js v16+ with npm
- Development server running with hot reload
- Electron with React and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Biome for linting and formatting
