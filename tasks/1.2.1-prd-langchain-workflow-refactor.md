# Product Requirements Document: LangChain Workflow Refactor

## Introduction/Overview

This project involves refactoring the existing OpenAI-based workflows for offer preparation and negotiation to use LangChain's **Agents and Tools** paradigm with **LangGraph** for state management. The current implementation uses direct OpenAI API calls through custom services, which will be replaced with modular LangChain agents that can leverage tools, memory, and streaming capabilities.

The refactor will transform the current workflow architecture from a custom orchestration system to a standardized LangChain-based approach, improving maintainability, extensibility, and developer experience while preserving existing functionality and interfaces.

## Goals

1. **Migrate to LangChain Architecture**: Replace direct OpenAI API calls with LangChain agents and tools
2. **Implement Modular Workflow Design**: Create independent workflow modules with shared common components
3. **Leverage LangGraph**: Use LangGraph for complex state management and workflow orchestration where appropriate
4. **Preserve Existing Interfaces**: Maintain current input/output contracts to avoid breaking UI components
5. **Enable Advanced Features**: Implement LangChain Memory and streaming capabilities where beneficial
6. **Improve Code Organization**: Create a scalable architecture that supports team collaboration
7. **Maintain Firebase Integration**: Preserve existing Firebase patterns for data persistence

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Comprehensive Testing Framework** - Will be added in future iterations
2. **Detailed Documentation** - Basic documentation only, comprehensive docs later
3. **Performance Optimization** - No specific performance requirements for initial implementation
4. **Caching Strategies** - Will be implemented in future phases
5. **LangChain Callbacks** - Monitoring and debugging callbacks not included initially
6. **LangChain Evaluators** - Quality assessment tools not included in initial scope
7. **Backward Compatibility** - No need to maintain old OpenAI-based implementations
8. **Feature Flags** - Direct replacement without gradual rollout
9. **Concurrency Handling** - Basic single-workflow execution initially
10. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Basic error handling only, advanced patterns later

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Pattern
- **Agents and Tools**: Each workflow becomes a specialized agent with domain-specific tools
- **LangGraph Workflows**: Complex orchestration uses LangGraph for state management
- **Modular Design**: Independent workflow modules with shared common components
- **Interface Preservation**: Maintain existing TypeScript contracts and Firebase patterns

### Technology Stack
- **LangChain JavaScript**: Primary framework for agent and tool implementation
- **LangGraph**: State management for complex workflows
- **OpenAI API**: Continue using existing OpenAI models through LangChain
- **Firebase**: Maintain existing data persistence patterns
- **TypeScript**: Preserve type safety and existing interfaces
