### Notes

- This implementation integrates with the existing agent workflow and Firebase backend
- Separate authentication flows will be created for agents and clients (buyers/sellers)
- Mock market data will be used instead of real MLS APIs
- PDF generation using Puppeteer for professional document output
- Firebase security rules must be properly configured for new collections
- OpenAI SDK v5.8.3 installed for GPT-4 integration
- Dependencies added: openai, puppeteer, marked, uuid, @types/marked, @types/uuid
- Extended auth types with USER_ROLES (agent, buyer, seller) and profile interfaces
- Added AgentProfile and ClientProfile interfaces with role-specific fields
- Created registration data types for both agents and clients
