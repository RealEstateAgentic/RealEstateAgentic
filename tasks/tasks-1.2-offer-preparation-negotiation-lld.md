### Notes

- This implementation integrates with the existing agent workflow and Firebase backend
- Separate authentication flows will be created for agents and clients (buyers/sellers)
- Mock market data will be used instead of real MLS APIs
- PDF generation will use libraries available in the merged codebase
- Firebase security rules must be properly configured for new collections
