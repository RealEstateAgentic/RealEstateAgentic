# Task List: Deal Pipeline Analytics - Negotiation Success Rate Tracking

Based on PRD: `1.3-prd-deal-pipeline-analytics.md`

## Relevant Files

- `src/lib/firebase/collections/negotiation-analytics.ts` - Firebase collection and queries for analytics data
- `src/lib/firebase/collections/negotiation-analytics.test.ts` - Unit tests for analytics collection
- `src/lib/analytics/negotiation-tracker.ts` - Core service for tracking negotiation data from workflows
- `src/lib/analytics/negotiation-tracker.test.ts` - Unit tests for negotiation tracker
- `src/lib/analytics/success-rate-calculator.ts` - Analytics engine for calculating success rates and generating insights
- `src/lib/analytics/success-rate-calculator.test.ts` - Unit tests for success rate calculator
- `src/lib/analytics/strategy-recommender.ts` - Predictive recommendation engine
- `src/lib/analytics/strategy-recommender.test.ts` - Unit tests for strategy recommender
- `src/renderer/components/analytics/AnalyticsReports.tsx` - UI component for displaying analytics reports
- `src/renderer/components/analytics/AnalyticsReports.test.tsx` - Unit tests for analytics reports component
- `src/renderer/components/analytics/StrategyRecommendations.tsx` - UI component for strategy recommendations
- `src/shared/types/analytics.ts` - TypeScript types for analytics data structures
- `src/lib/analytics/index.ts` - Main analytics module exports
- `firestore.rules` - Firebase security rules for analytics data access control

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Analytics data must be properly isolated by agent/user ID
- Integration with existing negotiation pipeline and document generation workflows is critical
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests
